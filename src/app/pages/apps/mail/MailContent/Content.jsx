            Any plans for the weekend? I was thinking of going hiking in the
            nearby mountains. It&apos;s been a while since we had some outdoor fun.
            If you&apos;re interested, let me know, and we can plan the details.

          <p className="mt-4">
            It&apos;ll be a great way to unwind and enjoy nature. Looking forward to
            your response!

        Major changes have recently occured in my life, both personally and
        professionally. We're approaching five years since the inception of this
        blog, and going back to read the posts from May &apos;04 is quite the
        experience. I suppose its what diaries and journals are for, the chance
        to go back and read out your thoughts and ideas from another time. Kind
        of like mental time travel.

        One thing is for sure, I am not who I was then. In fact, I am not who I
        was last year or the year before that. I may have some (we shed and
        create a lot of cells frequently) of the bodily composition of that
        person but we are definitely on different wavelengths.

        This whole blogging business started off as a documentation of odd and
        quirky ideas I might have. I had a lot of time on my hands back then,
        hence the frequency of the posts. With time, the posts have decreased in
        number but have also slightly sharpened in focus. They may still be
        random and don't generally adhere to one unified theme, but this thing
        was meant to be disjointed and arbitrary anyway.

          Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my h1 elements? How do
          I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?
